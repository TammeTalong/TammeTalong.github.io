My name is Samuel Meijer, I am 28 years old and come from Helsingborg, Sweden. I am an aspiring web developer and I am currently studying web programming at [Linné­universitetet](https://lnu.se).

I have always had a deep interest in computers and technology, without having any deeper knowledge about how they actually work. That was the reason why I decided to study to become a web developer as it combines technological knowledge with another thing i find enjoyable, problemsolving. Since i recently started I have only had time to dip my toes in the vast sea of knowledge that web development builds upon, but so far I find it extremely entertaining even tho it can also be very challenging.

Outside of technology my main interests are football(soccer) and fishing, and that is what I spend most of my free time on.  

I have played football for the most part of my life, ever since I was five years old, and spend a lot of time watching it aswell. My favorite team is Helsingborgs IF from Helsingborg, Sweden, and I have been following them during my whole life. I watch a lot of football from other leagues than Allsvenskan as well, mainly from Premier League and Bundesliga.

Fishing is mostly done in Öresund along the Scanian coast. The fish that I mainly try to catch is sea trout, but some cod, herring and mackerel usually also get caught. I also try to travel to the northern parts of Sweden or Norway at least once a year in search of charr, grayling and brown trout.
