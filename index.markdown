This webpage is made as part of my learning experience with _Jekyll_ and contains a brief introduction of who I am as well as the main content, a blog where I write about my learning experience. It was made with the intention to challenge and contain many of the different techniques offered by _Jekyll_ and _SCSS_. As a result, some of the design and content choices may not have been made in a way that can be described as "best practice".
